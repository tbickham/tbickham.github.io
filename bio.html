          <h2>Professional Objections</h2>

          <p>My current goal is to become a Game Designer and develop video games. My current plan of action is to get a Bachelor&#39;s degree since it is essential to get into the industry. I also study game design and development on my own time as well and even working on my own game project to get a better understanding of game development.</p>
