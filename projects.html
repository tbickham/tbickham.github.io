                    <h2>Shape Tactics - Unity</h2>
                    <p>A 2D game project I made on my own that is a tactics game on a square grid. Each shape has it's own abilities.<br>
					Triangles are able to attack. Squares can take multiple attacls. Crosses can heal damage or give a shield to an ally.<br><br>
					As for controls, left click an unit will let you choose where to move to.<br>
					Left clicking on another unit will bring the unit to the last possible space in the path and interact with the other unit.<br>
					You can cancel movement by right clicking. You can also segment your movement by clicking the mouse wheel.<br>
					You can move the camera with the WASD keys and toggle the grid with the G key.<br><br>
					I may add a build at some point in the future.</p>

                    <h2>Trivia Maze - C#</h2>
                    <p>A game where you must answer trivia questions in order to reach the exit. This is a team project which I worked
                    on the database for the game. The database contains all questions and answered used within the game. I also designed
                    a mode where you can add or remove questions from the game. The mode lets you make databases, tables, and rows. A database
                    would represent a theme, a table represent a category with the theme, and rows represent each question inside. Deleted data
                    becomes unavailable once the user commits their changes.</p>

                    <h2>Platformer - C#</h2>
                    <p>A simple platformer I made on my own for a final project. The game is primarily to try to learn how to use controls to make a playable
                    game. I also wanted the game to be able to accept a file and create a level purely on said file. Physics are focused on controlling the momentum
                    of your character.</p>

                    <h2>Plugin RPG - Java</h2>
                    <p>A RPG I made to experiment in. The main feature is the ability to load plugins (or mods) into the game in order to minimize the need to
                    make base edits. This system also exists so player can make their own content including world and story so they can effectively make their own game.</p>

                    <h2>Visual RPG - Java</h2>
                    <p>A RPG I made to experiment with graphics within a Java environment. The game is made with only the Java API, so I made a workaround so I can completely
                    control what is printed to the screen instead of fighting the Java Swing system. I also wanted to add a level of control to the game so players can move their
                    character or open a menu. I also wanted characters to be able to act on their own, so I made the system ahead of time to allow for that possibility which is shown
                    with a simple AI that follows the player on the map.</p>
